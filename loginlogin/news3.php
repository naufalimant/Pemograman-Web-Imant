        <p>Naomi Campbell wants to level the playing field. The supermodel has long been a dedicated
            supporter of fashion from across the African continent. And her latest project, in
            partnership with the Lagos, Nigeria-based culture and style magazine, Arise, aims to offer
            designers from across the diaspora an opportunity to showcase their wares on the world stage.
            Arise Fashion Week’s 30 Under 30 Contest, titled “the New Stars,” is set to introduce an array
            of young talents looking to make their mark. The four-day design competition kicked off yesterday.
            This year, the shows will be broadcast virtually, but the prizes—including a $500,000 first
            place grant—will be handed out in person by Campbell.</p>

        <p>Campbell has collaborated with Arise and its founder Nduka Obaigbena for years, taken on a
            larger role the last two years. Due to the events of 2020, many prominent design competitions have gone
            online, but Campbell, who will walk in the winner’s show and serve as host, felt it was essential to
            support the designers. The group will be present at the live venue, thanks to protective bubbles that
            separate judges and creators. This year's audience will catch all the action online, but Campbell felt
            it necessary to appear in person. “I didn’t want just to sit there and do it virtually,” she says, noting
            that every travel precaution was taken to ensure the safety of participants. “It’s important to me that
            they have the awareness and recognition that they should be getting, and if I can help bring that to them,
            I’m happy to do it.”</p>
