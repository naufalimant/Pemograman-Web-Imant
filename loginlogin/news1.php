        <p>Dua Lipa took the snow bunny look to bold new heights yesterday in New York City when she stepped out in
            a full head-to-toe print outfit. Her puffer coat, tights, and pumps all boasted the same, ’60s mod-style
            floral design from British designer Richard Quinn’s collaboration with Moncler. For a sliver of her
            signature midriff, she wore a black crop top under the puffer. Lipa hasn’t been the only person to
            champion this style: Céline Dion the head-turning same print as a dress, coat, and tights in March.</p>

        <p>Colder climes can force people into standard dressing habits, like puffers and sweats. (Call it
            hibernation wear!) But Lipa’s full-body, statement-making prints make dressing up in the freezing cold
            seem downright appealing. The look is refreshingly bright, and it seems that Lipa took that energy to
            heart. The entertainer had some fun yesterday in the look, and while frolicking in the snow, she posted
            an Instagram of herself with the caption: “avinnnn snow much fun!”</p>
